# HideAndGuess
This is a graded project for an introductory Android development course at the [Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen](https://www.thm.de/site/).

---

The app consists of a party drawing / guessing game in the style of [skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io/), [Gartic Phone](https://garticphone.com/), 
or similar examples, but with a twist:

Instead of drawing a prompt, the current drawer has to blur out parts of a given image instead.
The guessing players still have to recognize and type out the main subject of the image as fast as possible.
Points are given based on how much was blurred and on the time the individual guessers needed to get it right, 
which encourages the drawer to blur as little as possible to drive their own multiplier up.
Since they still need to keep it hard enough to cost the guessing players as much time as possible, this results in dynamic and risk-rewarding rounds.
